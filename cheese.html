        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            Grilled cheese is a classic American sandwich that is usually prepared with one 
            <br> or more cheese varieties that are placed between two slices of bread. 
            <br>The slices are buttered from the outside, and the sandwich is then 
            <br>shortly heated, typically in a pan or on a griddle, until the bread 
            <br>is golden and the cheese melts.
